### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**XGRAzgr/xgrazgr** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
-->

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on making and expand my website (https://xgrazgr.github.io/)
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m not looking on collaborating on any repository yet.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with simple JavaScript programs (like clocks, chatbots, and quizes)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like eating lemons.
